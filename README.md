1 Introduction

This workshop looks at setting up and using GitLab to support multidisciplinary teams working on capstone projects, 
games development and promotes group collaboration as a research tool. Key workshop discussion includes:

1.1  What are participants currently using as a source management tool?

1.2	At what level are source management tools being introduced?

1.3	Software development collaboration tools for software developers used as a CV.

1.4	Celebrating student achievements using a source management tool.

1.5	Are participants involved in research and what form?

1.6	Supporting contributions towards group research outputs: http://citrenz.ac.nz/jacit/

2.  Key Workshop Outputs
    The role GitLab plays in providing students with evidence for their CV’s to enable successful 
    participation in internship programmes and stair-casing into work.

    Using group collaboration as a methods to promote research outputs.

3.  What theorist are saying
    
    There is a potential for this transparency to radically improve collaboration and learning in complex
    knowledge-based activities.(Dabbish, Stuart, Tsay, & Herbsleb, 2012).

    Developers can thus track the activities relevant to various projects in one umbrella site. Such a 
    major change in collaborative software development makes an investigation of networkings on social 
    coding sites valuable. (Thung, Bissyande, Lo, & Lingxiao Jiang, 2013)

    Just got an email two days ago from an excoworker that I had not seen in a couple of years. 
    He said,“It's been great following you on GitHub. You provide the curation of a lot of the content 
    that I'm interested in because we have similar technical interests.(Bae & Kim, 2014)
